This is an inventory app which is my final project for my CS-360 mobile architecture class. The goal of this app is to help a user keep track of inventory within a SQLite database. The app also allows the user to set notifications via SMS when items are removed from the inventory. About 5 screens with many activities were necessary to accomplish this task. The approach I took to design this app was to look at how others created the same or similar apps. I was lucky enough to find many different examples and different ways of accomplishing the task that let me pick pieces from them and create my own. The biggest challenge I had to overcome was simply my time. With having another class, working full time, and having a family, it leaves me with little to no personal time so just finding the time to get work done was the hardest challenge. Despite dealing with some overwhelming odds, I feel like I came through this class with a lot of knowledge that will help me boost my career.
